# redis-chat-flask-api
Python-based Flask API for the Redis-based chat web app for NoSQL university project

The project was a Web chat application which used the rooms where the messages were published by the authenticated users.

My role in project was to make a background research on Redis, learn about its features and best practices, 
then to prepare the dataset and plan the flow of our application.

The source file is a Flask API for the application and it contains methods responsible for: 
sending a message, reading last message from the certain room, reading all messages from a certain room,
displaying leaderboard with the user activity.
