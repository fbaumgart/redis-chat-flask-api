# redis-chat-flask-api
Python-based Flask API for the Redis-based chat web app for NoSQL university project

The project was a Web chat application which used the rooms where the messages were published by the authenticated users.

https://redis.io/topics/introduction

My role in project was to make a background research on Redis (an in-memory, key-value database), learn about its features and best practices, 
then to prepare the Redis server, initial dataset, plan the flow of our application and to write part of the backend API code.

The source file is a Flask API for the application and it contains methods responsible for: 
sending a message, reading last message from the certain room, reading all messages from a certain room,
displaying leaderboard with the user activity.

PDF file contains a detailed project report in PL language.
